# Installation

Get started with **siimple** adding it to your project. We recommend installing **siimple** using the package manager **npm**.


### Use a package manager

**siimple** is [published in npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/siimple), so you can add it to your project running the following command:

```bash
$ npm install siimple --save
```

Be sure that you have **npm** installed in your computer. Get more information [about installing npm here](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node).

Alternatively, you can install **siimple** using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) instead of **npm** running the following command:

```bash
$ yarn add siimple --save
```

You can get more information [about installing yarn here](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started).


### Use a hosted version

You can use our hosted version in [JsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) and include **siimple** without installing any module. 
Check all available hosted versions [in the jsDelivr website](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/siimple), or copy and paste the following `<link>` element in your HTML file for adding the latest version:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/siimple/dist/siimple.min.css" />
```

You can also use [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/) for including the latest version in your HTML file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/siimple/dist/siimple.min.css" />
```
