# Components

We provide a collection of built-in UI components that you can customize and reuse across your projects, that includes buttons, alerts, navigation links, and more!

### Enable components module

Components are enabled by default as part of the `siimple.css()` mixin. It can be disabled setting to `false` the `"use-components"` flag in the `$flags` section of the configuration.

You can manually include the components module calling the `siimple.components()` mixin:

```scss
@use "siimple" as siimple;

// Include all components
@include siimple.components();
```

Also, instead of loading all components you can manually import individual components:

```scss
@use "siimple" as siimple;

// Include only alert and buttons
@include siimple.alert();
@include siimple.btn();
```

### Customize components

Variants can be used to customize and change the look and feel of components. Each component will look for a specific variant defined in the `$variants` section of your configuration.

```scss
@use "siimple" as siimple;

// Configure the button variants
@include siimple.configure(
    $variants: (
        "button": (
            "default": (
                "background-color": "primary",
                "color": "white",
            ),
            "secondary": (
                "background-color": "secondary",
            ),
        ),
    ),
);

// Include the buttons module
@include siimple.btn();
```
