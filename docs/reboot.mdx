# Reboot

This module provides a modern and generic CSS reset that must be used to reduce inconsistencies between different browsers.

### Enable reboot module

The reboot module is enabled by default as part of the `siimple.css()` mixin. It can be disabled setting to `false` the `"use-reboot"` flag in the `$flags` section of the configuration.

If you want to manually include the reboot module in your styles, just call the `siimple.reboot()` mixin:

```scss
@use "siimple" as siimple;

// Include reboot module
@include siimple.reboot();
```
