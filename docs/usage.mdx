# Usage

### CLI usage

You can use the siimple CLI tool to generate your customized version of siimple. First just create your configuration file `siimple.config.js` in the root of your project:

```js title=siimple.config.js
export default {
    /* Configuration */
};
```

You can learn more about the configuration file for siimple in the [configuration](/configuration) section.

After creating your configuration file, just run the siimple CLI tool to generate your CSS:

```bash
$ npx siimple -c ./siimple.config.js -o ./output.css
```

This will generate a file called `output.css` with the compiled styles of siimple.
