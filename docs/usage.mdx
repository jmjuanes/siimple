# Usage


### Using the precompiled version

The npm package comes with a ready to use CSS version, so you can just use the CSS file in your project:

```html title=index.html
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <link href="./node_modules/siimple/siimple.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1 class="title is-1">Hello world!</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

You can also use the precompiled version available from a CDN. See the [installation](/installation) section to learn more.


### CLI usage

You can use the siimple CLI tool to generate your customized version of siimple. First just create your configuration file `siimple.config.js` in the root of your project:

```js title=siimple.config.js
export default {
    prefix: "",
    scales: {},
    variants: {},
    plugins: [],
};
```

You can learn more about the configuration file for siimple in the [configuration](/configuration) section.

After creating your configuration file, just run the siimple CLI tool to generate your CSS:

```bash
$ npx siimple -c ./siimple.config.js -o ./output.css
```

This will generate a file called `output.css` with the compiled styles of siimple. Remember to copy the fonts files `siimple-icons.ttf` and `siimple-icons.woff` from the siimple package to your root folder in case that you want to use the icons plugin.
