# Responsive

The **siimple** toolkit has been designed to be fully responsive, so you can design an fully adaptative user interface.

A high number of helpers and components of the **siimple** toolkit can be conditionally applied at different breakpoints, so you can customize how the user interface will be presented on different screen sizes.

By default, we provide four screen breakpoints:

| Prefix | Description | CSS media query |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| mobile | Applied to screen sizes up to `599px`. | `@media (max-width: 599px)` |
| tablet | Applied to screen sizes from `600px`. | `@media (min-width: 600px)` |
| desktop | Applied to screen sizes from `1200px`. | `@media (min-width: 1200px)` |
| fullhd | Applied to screen sizes from `1800px`. | `@media (min-width: 1800px)` |


The following example uses these responsive variants to customize how the card will be displayed for different screen sizes:

```html live=true bg=blue-200
<div class="has-radius has-bg-white has-overflow-hidden has-flex mobile:has-flex-column">
    <div>
        <img class="has-w-64 has-h-full mobile:has-w-full" src="/landscape1.jpg" />
    </div>
    <div class="has-p-6">
        <div class="siimple-title is-4">Hello world!</div>
        <div class="siimple-paragraph has-mb-0">
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor 
            incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```
