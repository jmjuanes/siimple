# Components

We provide a collection of built-in UI components that you can customize and reuse across your projects, that includes buttons, alerts, navigation links, and more!

You can load the components plugin calling the `plugin-components()` function in the `$plugins` section of your configuration:

```scss
@use "siimple" as siimple;

@include siimple.configure(
    $plugins: (
        siimple.plugin-components(),
    ),
);
```

Also, instead of loading all components you can manually import individual components:

```scss
@use "siimple" as siimple;

@include siimple.configure(
    $plugins: (
        siimple.plugin-btn(),
        siimple.plugin-column(),
    ),
);
```

### Variants

Variants can be used to customize and change the look and feel of components. Each component will look for a specific variant defined in the `$variants` section of your configuration.

```scss
@use "siimple" as siimple;

@include siimple.configure(
    $plugins: (
        siimple.plugin-btn(),
    ),
    $variants: (
        "button": (
            "default": (
                "background-color": "primary",
                "color": "white",
            ),
            "secondary": (
                "background-color": "secondary",
            ),
        ),
    ),
);
```
