# Utilities

The **utilities** module provides a collection of **small functional CSS classes** that can be used for creating or customizing components. The main aim of this module is to provide a collection of reusable classes to replace the conventional style of writting CSS classes.

Utilities are enabled by default as part of the `siimple.css()` mixin. It can be disabled setting to `false` the `"use-utilities"` flag in the `$flags` section of the configuration.

If you want to manually including the utilities module in your styles, just call the `siimple.utilities()` mixin:

```scss
@use "siimple" as siimple;

// Include all utilities
@include siimple.utilities();
```

Additionally, in case that you are only interested in some utilities you can load each helper individually instead of loading all utilities:

```scss
@use "siimple" as siimple;

// Include only some utilities
@include siimple.color-utilities();
@include siimple.spacing-utilities();
@include siimple.sizing-utilities();
```
