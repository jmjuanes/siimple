# Getting started

**siimple** is [published in npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/siimple), so you can add it to your project running the following command:

```bash
$ npm install siimple --save
```

Be sure that you have **npm** installed in your computer. Get more information [about installing npm here](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node).

Alternatively, you can install **siimple** using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) instead of **npm** running the following command:

```bash
$ yarn add siimple --save
```

You can get more information [about installing yarn here](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started).

### CLI usage

You can use the siimple CLI tool to generate your customized version of siimple. First just create your configuration file `siimple.config.js` in the root of your project:

```js title=siimple.config.js
import colors from "@siimple/colors";
import theme from "@siimple/theme";
import elements from "@siimple/preset-elements";

export default {
    ...theme,
    useRootStyles: false,
    useBorderBox: true,
    prefix: "",
    colors: {
        primary: colors.blue["500"],
        secondary: colors.mint["600"],
        text: colors.gray["800"],
        background: "#fff",
        muted: colors.gray["200"],
    },
    fonts: {
        body: ["Roboto", "sans-serif"],
        heading: ["Montserrat", "sans-serif"],
        code: ["monospace"],
    },
    styles: {
        ...elements.styles,
    },
};
```

You can learn more about the configuration file for siimple in the [configuration](/configuration) section.

After creating your configuration file, just run the siimple CLI tool to generate your CSS:

```bash
$ npx siimple -c ./siimple.config.js -o ./output.css
```

This will generate a file called `output.css` with the compiled styles of siimple. 


### Use the hosted CSS version

You can use our hosted CSS version in [JsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) and include **siimple** without installing any module. Note that:

- You can not customize the default theme.
- You can not customize the default modules (elements, helpers, ...).
- You can not provide your custom styles.
- You can not use third-party presets.

Check all available hosted versions [in the jsDelivr website](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/siimple), or copy and paste the following `<link>` element in your HTML file for adding the latest version:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/siimple/siimple.css" />
```

You can also use [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/) for including the latest version in your HTML file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/siimple/siimple.css" />
```
