# Spinner

The **siimple spinner** is a pure CSS loading indicator used for showing the loading state in your website or application. For creating a spinner, just add a `spinner` class to any `<div>` element:

```html live=true align=center
<div class="spinner"></div>
```

### Variants

Variants for this component can be defined in the `spinner` section of the variants configuration:

```scss
@include siimple.configure(
    $variants: (
        "spinner": (
            "default": (
                "color": "primary",
            ),
        ),
    ),
);
```
