# Scrim

> This component is part of the **experimental** components module.

A **scrim** is a visual element that blocks the interaction with the background elements, allowing only to interact with the elements inside the scrim.

You can create a scrim using the class `siimple-scrim`. By default, all elements inside the scrim will be centered in the screen.

```html
<div class="siimple-scrim">
    Content of the scrim
</div>
```
