# Content

A **content** is a layout component that divides your website in section and places the information it contains in the center of the window in every moment. Add the class `content` to your container `<div>` to use it:

```html
<div class="content">
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit...
</div>
```

By default the container has the maximun width minus the `24px` of padding left and right. You can change the width of the content element using one of the following sizing variants:

| Variant | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| `small` | It will have a maximum width of `560px`. |
| `medium` | It will have a maximum width of `720px`. |
| `large` | It will have a maximum width of `960px`. |
| `xlarge` | It will have a maximum width of `1140px`. |
| `huge` | It will have a maximum width of `1280px`. |

On screens with sizes lower than the specified in the sizing modifier, the container will have the maximun width.

```html
<div class="content is-medium">
    Max 768px container
</div>
```

### Variants

Variants for this component can be defined in the `layout.content` section of the variants configuration:

```scss
@include siimple.configure(
    $variants: (
        "layout.content": (
            "default": (
                "max-width": "560px",
            ),
        ),
    ),
);
```
