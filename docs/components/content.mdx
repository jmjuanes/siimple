# Content

A **content** is a layout component that divides your website in section and places the information it contains in the center of the window in every moment. Add the class `content` to your container `<div>` to use it:

```html
<div class="content">
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit...
</div>
```

By default the container has the maximun width minus the `32px` of padding left and right. You can change the width of the content element using one of the following sizing variants:

| Variant | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| `tablet` | It will have a maximum width of `640px`. |
| `desktop` | It will have a maximum width of `1264px`. |
| `widescreen` | It will have a maximum width of `1504px`. |

On screens with sizes lower than the specified in the sizing modifier, the container will have the maximun width.

```html
<div class="content is-tablet">
    Max 640px container
</div>
```

### Variants

Variants for this component can be defined in the `layout.content` section of the variants configuration:

```scss
@include siimple.configure(
    $variants: (
        "layout.content": (
            "default": (
                "max-width": "560px",
            ),
        ),
    ),
);
```
