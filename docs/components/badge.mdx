# Badge

**Badges** are useful elements for indicating status, attach metadata to another element or displaying numbers for counts. You can easily turn a `<span>` or `<div>` element to a badge adding the `badge` class.

```html live=true
<span class="badge">Badge</span>
<span class="badge is-secondary">Badge</span>
```

### Variants

Variants for this component can be defined in the `badge` section of the variants configuration:

```scss
@include siimple.configure(
    $variants: (
        "badge": (
            "primary": (
                "background-color": "primary",
                "color": "white",
            ),
            "secondary": (
                "background-color": "secondary",
                "color": "white",
            ),
        ),
    ),
);
```
