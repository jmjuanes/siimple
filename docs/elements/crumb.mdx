# Crumb

The breadcrumb is an easy-to-use element to keep track of the path the user has navigated. 
Each item should have the `crumb` class, and you can use the additional `crumbs` class to wrap all crumb elements:

```html live=true
<div class="crumbs has-mb-0">
    <a href="#" class="crumb">Home</a>
    <a href="#" class="crumb">About</a>
    <a href="#" class="crumb">Contact</a>
</div>
```

We provide an `active` variant to mark a crumb as active, for example to inform the user about the current page.

```html live=true
<div class="crumbs has-mb-0">
    <a href="#" class="crumb">Home</a>
    <a href="#" class="crumb">About</a>
    <a href="#" class="crumb is-active">Contact us</a>
</div>
```

### Variants

Variants for this element can be defined in the `navigation.crumb` section of the variants configuration:

```js
export default {
    variants: {
        "navigation.crumb": {
            active: {
                cursor: "default",
                opacity: "1.0",
                pointerEvents: "none",
            },
        },
    },
};
```
