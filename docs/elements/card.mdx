# Card

A **card** is a flexible container element that holds content and actions about a single subject or topic. By default, cards have no fixed width. A card can be created adding a `card` class to a `<div>` tag.


```html live=true
<div class="card has-mx-auto has-maxw-96 has-shadow">
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. 
</div>
```

### Variants

Variants for this element can be defined in the `cards` section of your theme configuration. The properties defined in the `cards.default` variant will be applied to the base card class:

```js
export default {
    cards: {
        // Will be applied to '.cards'
        default: {
            backgroundColor: "white",
            color: "inherit",
        },
    },
};
```
