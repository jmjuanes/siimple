# Container

A **container** is a layout element that divides your website in sections and places the information it contains in the center of the window in every moment. Add the class `container` to your `<div>` to use it:

```html
<div class="container">
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit...
</div>
```

By default the container has the maximun width minus the `32px` of padding left and right. You can customize the maximum width of the container providing your custom `maxWidth` value in the container variant field of your theme (see below).

### Variants

Variants for this element can be defined in the `layout.container` section of the variants configuration:

```js
export default {
    layout: {
        container: {
            maxWidth: "560px",
        },
    },
};
```
