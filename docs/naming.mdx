# Naming methodology

The **siimple** toolkit uses a simplified version of the [**SMACSS** methodology](http://smacss.com) for naming classnames, as described on this section. We have divided the classnames used in **siimple** into four blocks:

- **Components**: are the primary building blocks of **siimple**.
- **Icons**: used for displaying icons.
- **Variant modifiers**: used to change the default style of each component.
- **Utility modifiers**: low-level classnames that can be applied to any element.
 

### Components 

We use the following syntax for naming **components** in siimple:

```
.<Prefix><ComponentName>
```

Where:

- `<Prefix>`: is the components prefix that can be customized in the `$prefix` section of the configuration. The default prefix applied in **siimple** is an empty string.
- `<ComponentName>` is the component name, for example `btn` or `navbar`.


### Icons

Icons defined in siimple have the following classname pattern:

```
.icon-<IconName>
```


### Variant modifiers

**Variant modifiers** are special classnames used to change the default style of a component. Variant modifiers always use the following syntax:

```
.is-<VariantName>
```

The following example shows how to use the `secondary` variant of a button:

```html
<button class="btn is-secondary">
    Secondary button
</button>
```

Every component must define its own variants, and some variant modifiers that works for some components may not be available for another components. This means that `is-secondary` modifier can be applied for example to a `btn` component, but has no effect when applied to `card`.


### Utility modifiers

**Utility modifiers** are a collection of low-level classnames that can be used in any element to modify some CSS properties. These modifiers follows this syntax:

```
.has-<UtilityValue>
```

#### Responsive modifiers

Some utilities modifiers can be applied conditionally at different breakpoints, for building adaptative and responsive interfaces. 

```
.<BreakpointValue>:has-<UtilityValue>
```


#### Status modifiers

Similar to responsive modifiers, you can apply some utilities only in response to an specific status of the element. 

##### Hover status

Add the `hover:` prefix to a utility class to apply it only on hover: 

```html live=true align=center
<div class="btn has-text-white has-bg-purple-500 hover:has-bg-purple-700">
    Hoverable button
</div>
```
