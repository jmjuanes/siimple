# Plugins

Plugins allows you to extend **siimple** adding more styles like components, helpers or icons. 



## Built-in plugins
### Components

We provide a collection of built-in UI components that you can customize and reuse across your projects, that includes buttons, alerts, navigation links, and more!

You can load the components plugin calling the `plugin-components()` function in the `$plugins` section of your configuration:

```scss
@use "siimple" as siimple;

@include siimple.configure(
    $plugins: (
        siimple.plugin-components(),
    ),
);
```

Also, instead of loading all components you can manually import individual components:

```scss
@use "siimple" as siimple;

@include siimple.configure(
    $plugins: (
        siimple.plugin-btn(),
        siimple.plugin-column(),
    ),
);
```

### Helpers

The **helpers** plugin provides a collection of **small functional CSS classes** that can be used for creating or customizing components. The main aim of this plugin is to provide a collection of reusable classes to replace the conventional style of writting CSS classes.

To load the helpers plugin, just add the `plugin-helpers()` function in the `$plugins` section of your configuration:

```scss
@include siimple.configure(
    $plugins: (
        siimple.plugin-helpers(),
    ),
);
```

Additionally, in case that you are only interested in some helpers you can load each helper individually instead of loading all helpers:

```scss
@include siimple.configure(
    $plugins: (
        siimple.plugin-color-helpers(),
        siimple.plugin-spacing-helpers(),
        siimple.plugin-sizing-helpers(),
    ),
);
```


### Icons plugin

The icons plugin can be enabled just adding the `plugin-icons()` function in the `$plugins` section of your configuration:

```scss
@include siimple.configure(
    $plugins: (
        siimple.plugin-icons(),
    ),
);
```

This will add the `siimple-icon` component to your output CSS, and will generate one variant for each icon. The following options can be used to customize the icons plugin:

- `path`: path to the fonts folder. By default is `./`. **The path must end with a `/`**.
- `include`: if provided, only icons in this list will be included for the output CSS.
- `exclude`: if provided, icons in this list will be excluded from the output CSS.

Example: 

```scss
@include siimple.configure(
    $plugins: (
        siimple.plugin-icons((
            "path": "./fonts/",
            "include": (
                "star",
                "user",
            ),
        )),
    ),
);
```

> Remember to copy all fonts in the `siimple` package to your project assets folder and use the `path` option to set the path to the fonts folder.
